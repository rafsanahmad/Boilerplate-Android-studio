    /*Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
    If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

    //Printing Longest Common Subsequence
    /*Given two sequences, print the longest subsequence present in both of them.

Examples:
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.

Approach:
1. Construct L[m+1][n+1] using the steps discussed in previous post.
2. The value L[m][n] contains length of LCS. Create a character array lcs[] of length equal to the length of lcs plus
1 (one extra to store \0).
3. Traverse the 2D array starting from L[m][n]. Do following for every cell L[i][j]
4. If characters (in X and Y) corresponding to L[i][j] are same (Or X[i-1] == Y[j-1]), then include this character as
part of LCS.
Else compare values of L[i-1][j] and L[i][j-1] and go in direction of greater value.
