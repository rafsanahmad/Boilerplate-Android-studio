    /*Problem Statement
You are given the schedule of N meetings with their start time Start[i] and end time End[i]. But you have only 1 meeting room.
So, you need to tell the meeting numbers you can organize in the given room, such that the number of meetings organized is
maximum.
Note:
The start time of one chosen meeting canâ€™t be equal to the end time of the other chosen meeting. Also for the same end time,
 a meeting with a smaller index is preferred.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases or queries to be run.

The first line of each test case or query contains a single integers 'N' denoting the number of meetings.

The second line of each test case contains N single space-separated integers denoting the start time of N meetings respectively.

The third line of each test case contains N single space-separated integers denoting the end time of N meetings respectively.
Output Format:
For each test case, print the meeting numbers (Consider 1 based indexing) you organized in the given room, in the order in
which you organized them such that the number of meetings is maximum.
Note:
You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= Start[i] < End[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
6
1 3 0 5 8 5
2 4 6 7 9 9
3
1 1 1
4 5 9

Sample Output 1:
1 2 4 5
1

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For test case 1:
You can organize a maximum of 4 meetings. Meeting number 1 from 1 to 2, Meeting number 2 from 3 to 4, Meeting number
4 from 5 to 7, and Meeting number 5 from 8 to 9.

For test case 2:
As all meetings have the same start time, you can organize only 1 meeting in the room.

Sample Input 2:
2
5
0 7 1 4 8
2 9 5 9 10
3
1 2 3
4 4 4
Sample Output 2:
