public class DetectCycleInUndirectedGraph {
    /*Problem Description

Given an undirected graph having A nodes labelled from 1 to A with M edges given in a form of matrix B of size M x 2
 where (B[i][0], B[i][1]) represents two nodes B[i][0] and B[i][1] connected by an edge.

Find whether the graph contains a cycle or not, return 1 if cycle is present else return 0.

NOTE:

The cycle must contain atleast three nodes.
There are no self-loops in the graph.
There are no multiple edges between two nodes.
The graph may or may not be connected.
Nodes are numbered from 1 to A.
Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A, M <= 310^5

1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A


Input Format
The first argument given is an integer A representing the number of nodes in the graph.

The second argument given is an matrix B of size M x 2 which represents the M edges such that there is a edge between
node B[i][0] and node B[i][1].


Output Format
Return 1 if cycle is present else return 0.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 5
 B = [  [1. 2]
        [1, 3]
        [2, 3]
        [1, 4]
        [4, 5]
     ]

Input 2:
 A = 3
 B = [  [1. 2]
        [1, 3]
     ]


Example Output
Output 1:
 1

Output 2:
 0

Example Explanation*
Explanation 1:
 There is a cycle in the graph i.e 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 so we will return 1

Explanation 2:
 No cycle present in the graph so we will return 0.*/
